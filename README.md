# About the Course
The fast.ai course is a practical, hands-on deep learning program designed to make cutting-edge AI techniques accessible to everyone. It covers topics like computer vision, natural language processing, and tabular data, using the FastAI library built on PyTorch.
This repo contains my personal notes and projects as I follow along with the lessons.
